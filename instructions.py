Thank you for cloning my module!  
The module can calculate the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle.

To use this:    
Create an object of the triangle class 
    t = Triangle()


The triangles 3 sides are called a, b, c.  
a and b can be set by typing t.a = 20 and t.b = 10  
You can see the values of a and b by typing t.a and t.b  
Typing t.c will give you a calculated value of c.
